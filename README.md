# Big Data Analysis with Vagrant

This repository contains a Vagrant-based environment setup for performing data analysis using the **CDC Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset**. 

This Project was implemented in the context of Big Data Analytics and Text Mining class from UNIBO's Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.


## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting with the Vagrant environment, ensure that the following tools are installed on your local machine:

- **Vagrant**: A tool for building and maintaining virtualized development environments.
- **VirtualBox**: A free and open-source hosted hypervisor for running virtual machines.
- **Git**: Version control system for managing project files.

### Project Files

- `Vagrantfile`: Configuration file for setting up the virtual machine.
- `bootstrap.sh`: Shell script for provisioning the VM and installing necessary packages and dependencies.

### Local Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sophie-mc-dev/unibo-big-data-analytics.git
   cd unibo-big-data-analytics
   ```

2. **Start the Vagrant VM:**

   This command will download the specified Ubuntu box, create a virtual machine, and provision it with the required tools and packages.

   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

   - The VM will be configured with:
     - Python 3
     - Jupyter Notebook
     - Apache Hadoop 3.4.0
     - Various Python data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib)
     - VNC server for graphical interface (optional)

3. **Access Jupyter Notebook:**

   Once the Vagrant VM is up and running, you can access Jupyter Notebooks by navigating to:

   - [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888)

   You can access the notebooks and start your data analysis tasks from this interface.

4. **Working with Notebooks:**

   You can create new notebooks or open existing ones from the shared folder (`./notebooks` in the repository). Any changes made will be reflected in both the VM and your local machine.

### Directory Structure

- `notebooks/`: Directory for storing your Jupyter Notebooks. The folder is shared between your local machine and the Vagrant VM.
- `Vagrantfile`: Vagrant configuration file for setting up the environment.
- `bootstrap.sh`: Shell script for provisioning the VM with required tools and dependencies.

## Configuration and Customization

You can modify the `bootstrap.sh` file to install additional tools or change configuration based on your needs. The Vagrant configuration (`Vagrantfile`) can also be adjusted to allocate more resources (e.g., more RAM or CPU cores) if needed.

## Requirements

### Python Libraries:

- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

## Notes

- **.vagrant folder**: This folder is generated by Vagrant to store VM state and should not be committed to version control.
- **Shared Folder**: The folder `./notebooks` on your local machine is synchronized with `/home/vagrant/notebooks` inside the Vagrant VM. Any files placed here can be accessed from both environments.
- **Modifying bootstrap.sh**: When making changes to the `bootstrap.sh` file, make sure to run the following command:

```bash
   vagrant reload --provision
```
